# 💡 Why Jensen?

I built Jensen to simplify my own daily life as a parent — making it effortless to manage shopping, schedules, and tasks through a natural, chat-driven interface. I then attempted to turn it into a company that would help other parents as well. Turns out parents are difficult customers for word of mouth products. They don't spend a lot of time talking to each other and when they do they don't really recommend apps to each other.
